In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards
electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources
such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional
gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types
and grades available to consumers.

For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car
manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize
profitability while meeting consumer demand?

It was required to build an interactive dashboard in Excel from the tasks given
below:

1. How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market
categories?

2. What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?

3. Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?

4. How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?

5. What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of
cylinders in a car's engine?

Now for the Next portion of the Project, it was required to create the
Interactive Dashboard. The client has requested these questions given below:

1. How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style?

2. Which car brands have the highest and lowest average MSRPs, and how
does this vary by body style?

3. How do the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP,
and how does this vary by body style?

4. How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across different body styles and
model years?

5. How does the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different
Brands?
